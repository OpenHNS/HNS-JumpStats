### Basic stats
![stats1](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/ef21fd88-a348-42d9-99ec-1588e196bdb4) ![stats2](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/b69af4f2-1ef6-4c19-934a-1f963b7750d9) ![stats5](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/3532d455-5ded-4d3c-8233-bc7b1be9b12d)

![stats3](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/97c7b379-874d-4adb-97a2-03164eac9bc6) ![stats4](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/df1b2208-9d1c-4863-add3-941b1c4f5114) ![stats6](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/fb2b9f98-790e-476e-86d1-3cdd3f67ad66)

- The first line of stats shows the name of the jump. Also shows the type of jump (Ladder / Drop / Up / SideWays / BackWards). And number of dacs.
- Distance of the jump.
- Then comes all elements of the pre-strike (starting with the last one).
- Final Speed - maximum speed at the end of the jump.
- Number of strafe

### Strife statistics

![strafe](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/8591efa7-1a42-4612-abc9-228dc188ed00)

1. Keys pressed.
2. Gain, i.e. the increase in speed gained in the corresponding strafe.
3. Loss, i.e. loss of velocity at the corresponding strafe.
4. Number of frames the strafe lasted.
5. the efficiency of a strafe, i.e. the ratio of the number of strafe that gave a speed gain to the total number of frames for each strafe, as a percentage.
6. The total number of Gain for all straights.
7. Total efficiency of the strafe (jump).
8. Information about block, jof and land (see below for details).

### Block Jof Land

### prestreifs (prespeed - jof, speed, speed)

![prespeed](https://github.com/WessTorn/HNS-JumpStats/assets/63194135/ee3d850a-7739-480d-b9c1-8ac023ad5666)

Prespeed (hud) displays jof, prespeed type, speed, FOG and prestrafe pre - speed before jump or duck (before hitting the ground) / post - speed after

FOG (frames on the ground) - in a nutshell, this is the number of frames (frames) on the ground.
- Why are we shown the FOG and what do we need to know?

  FOG we are shown during bhops and dhacks (dd), thereby we understand how much we are on the ground and how much speed we lose.

  Simply put, the lower the FOG, the less speed you lose. The pre/post speed shows us how much speed we have lost on the ground.

  But, due to the nature of the engine, if you have a speed higher than 299.973 u/s during bhops, then you will lose a lot of speed anyway.
